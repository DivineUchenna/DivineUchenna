I'm currently on my second year studying cybersecurity and digital forensics at Leeds Beckett University and i'm planning to specialise in the cybersecurity field (i would rather implement security systems than collect digital evidence). During my years at the university, i developed a passion about understanding how systems and networks operate, and more importantly, how to protect them. My main interest are ethical hacking and system security, which are the subjects that i am currently studying right now (with an hidden interest for coding). The subjects that a mentioned focus their attention in finding vulnerabilities in any system firewell to test system and provide detailed analysis which i find very interesting. I enjoy solving problems, learning independently, and developing techincal and analytical mindset that i can utilize to work in the cybersecurity field.
